# KNN_TUTORIAL
---

In this project, we explore K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from scratch to advanced concepts. It’s not aimed specifically at beginners or experts, but at learners who want to understand KNN thoroughly and refresh their knowledge. We will build KNN completely from scratch, progressing from an introduction to a real-world project. This tutorial covers how KNN works with real-world datasets, the mathematical intuition behind it, and how majority voting and averaging are used for predictions. We will implement KNN for both classification and regression tasks, and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. By the end, you’ll have a strong practical and theoretical grasp of KNN.

## 📘 Introduction to KNN

## What is KNN?

KNN stands for **K-Nearest Neighbors**. It is one of the algorithms under **supervised machine learning**.  

👉 If you want more clarity about machine learning and supervised learning, check my [Linear Regression repository](https://github.com/harshavardhanBOMMALATA/Linear-Regression.git).  

KNN can be used for both **regression** and **classification**, but it is mostly applied in **classification problems**.  

The algorithm works based on the concept of **neighbors**.  

**Example:**
- A person with **black hair, light brown skin tone, and thick eyebrows** might be classified as **Indian**.  
- A person with a **dark black skin tone** might be classified as **African**.  

This is how KNN makes predictions — by looking at the closest neighbors and deciding based on similarity.

## How KNN Works and Why It Works

KNN works on the basis of **neighbors**.  

1. It takes all the data points.  
2. For a given input data point, it calculates how close it is to the other points using a **distance formula** (like Euclidean distance).  
3. It then selects the **k nearest points**.  
4. For **classification**, it performs a **majority vote** among those neighbors and assigns the class based on the highest votes.  
5. For **regression**, instead of voting, it takes the **average** of the neighbors’ values.  

👉 **Why does it work?**  
Because the algorithm makes predictions by checking the closest neighbors. Data points that are close to each other usually share similar characteristics, so this method is both simple and effective.
