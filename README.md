# KNN_TUTORIAL
---

In this project, we explore K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from scratch to advanced concepts. It’s not aimed specifically at beginners or experts, but at learners who want to understand KNN thoroughly and refresh their knowledge. We will build KNN completely from scratch, progressing from an introduction to a real-world project. This tutorial covers how KNN works with real-world datasets, the mathematical intuition behind it, and how majority voting and averaging are used for predictions. We will implement KNN for both classification and regression tasks, and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. By the end, you’ll have a strong practical and theoretical grasp of KNN.
